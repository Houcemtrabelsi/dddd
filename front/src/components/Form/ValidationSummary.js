//
// Validation summaries are components used to provide an overall summary of the form validation status.
//    They can be positioned at the top or bottom of the form and display a list of all the errors
//    or validation issues found in the form as a whole.
//    This summary helps users identify all the validation errors at once,
//    making it easier for them to fix multiple issues at the same time.
